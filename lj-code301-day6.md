After week one, i'm feeling ok about things. I'm not 100% were I would like to be at, but I'm doing ok, so just got to keep going and keep trying.
A lot of the work this week was with jQuery, which so far is just JavaScript 
with a few different things that make some things easier,
but its still JavaScript so its still hard even with JQuery.
