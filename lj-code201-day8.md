Today was not as bad as yesterday. The day started off with a VERY useful code review that help a lot with some things, I still don't get a lot
 of it but I know more now then yesterday. Then the lab which I thought was going to be easy turn out not to be that easy, so tomorrow I'm
  going to have to ask for help to finish it.
