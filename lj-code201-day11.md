Today a supposed chill day, and then it was one of the hardest day so far. JavaScript is hard, every time I think I know what im doing
 JavaScript just says no and everything goes up in flames, and then I have no idea what I doing, and I just sit here looking at the computer
 wonder why it doesn't work getting more and more lost.
